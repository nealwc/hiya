```

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in the root directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

After all installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
